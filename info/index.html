hi chai

theres not much important here, just some info on how the website works in case youre interested, but you really dont have to read it at all, you can click the heart to go back

media is shown from a random position in the list, therefore you might get older tweets as the first results, you can reload the page in order to be given a new random position

the first time you view a list in a while it will load a little longer than normal, about 5-10 seconds, this is because its trying to load as many recent tweets from the list as it can

the exact amount that can be loaded depends on how often tweets appear in the list and how many of them contain an image/gif/video, but usually it should be able to get at least a few hundred of them

these results are cached, up to a 1000 of the most recent tweets are stored and will be shown at random, as a result removing or adding accounts to a list wont immediately have an effect on the media shown, but the change will be there for any new tweets

i do not recommend using 4 or 5 columns, especially on mobile, as loading the media can be very heavy and cause some problems

videos should try to autoplay, but they might not always do so, you can get them to play by clicking them

feel free to make your own lists, as long as they are public you can view them by putting in the link, they will not automatically appear under "View other lists" but i can add them manually if you want, otherwise you can copy the url at the top while viewing a list, the list is stored as the large number at the end of the url
